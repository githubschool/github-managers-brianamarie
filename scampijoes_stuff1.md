# Some ideas

## Dinner

* Zur Post: simple but delicious restaurant in Reifenberg - do not forget a reservation; note that the restaurant will close down in June/July 2018, so hurry up ;-)
* Schnitzelhaus: Although it does not sound like that, but a pretty good Indian restaurant
* Naiv in Frankfurt: Good collection of CraftBeer üç∫ and delicious bistro kitchen + good service
* Lodge Opel Zoo - steaks, steaks, steaks ... go for it
